# DeepLearning
Deep Learning Projects I have worked on ranging from image generation using stable diffusion to the creation of a convolutional neural network for image classification
- Single_input: Create an image from a single input
- Diffusers_test: Create an image from multiple inputs using stable diffusion. Also testing how the number of inference steps effects the final image
- CNN_Playground: Testing laplacian and gaussian filters and creating a convolutional neural network for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset
